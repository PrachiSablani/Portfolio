							<p>Casual Modeling is a very common task in economics/government/business analytics. In this project, my objective is to estimate the casual impact of Progresa program on the schooling outcomes of individuals in Mexico. I have focussed on the impact of the program on the poor, since only the poor were eligible to receive the Progresa assistance.<br>

To analyze the casual effect, I have used the following estimators -<br>
<ul>
	<li>Before-After estimator</li>
	<li>Cross-sectional estimator</li>
	<li>Differences-in-differences estimator</li>
</ul>

Lastly, I have clearly stated the underlying assumptions behind each estimator and compared the results of all three estimators.

Background Information - Progresa was a a government social assistance program in Mexico. This program, as well as the details of its impact, are described in the paper "School subsidies for the poor: evaluating the Mexican Progresa poverty program", by Paul Shultz.<br><br>

The timeline of the program was:
<ul>
<li>Baseline survey conducted in 1997</li>
<li>Intervention begins in 1998, "Wave 1" of data collected in 1998</li>
<li>"Wave 2 of data" collected in 1999</li>
<li>Evaluation ends in 2000, at which point the control villages were treated.</li>
</ul>

Each row in the data corresponds to an observation taken for a given child for a given year. There are two years of data (1997 and 1998), and just under 40,000 children who are surveyed in both years. For each child-year observation, the following variables are collected:<br>
year: year in which data is collected<br>
sex: male = 1<br>
indig: indigenous = 1<br>
dist_sec: nearest distance to a secondary school<br>
sc: enrolled in school in year of survey (=1)<br>
grc: grade enrolled<br>
fam_n: family size<br>
min_dist: min distance to an urban center<br>
dist_cap: min distance to the capital<br>
poor: poor = "pobre", not poor = "no pobre"<br>
progresa: treatment = "basal", control = "0"<br>
hohedu: years of schooling of head of household<br>
hohwag: monthly wages of head of household<br>
welfare_index: welfare index used to classify poor<br>
hohsex: gender of head of household (male=1)<br>
hohage: age of head of household<br>
age: years old<br>
folnum: individual id<br>
village: village id<br>
sc97 enrolled in school in 1997 (=1)</p>

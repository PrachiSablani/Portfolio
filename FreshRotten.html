The objective of this project is to implement <b>Naive Bayes Classifier</b> from scratch in Python to categorize Rotten Tomatoes reviews into rotten and fresh ones and to find the optimal smoothing parameter.<br><br>


The data has around 13000 reviews with features like – Movie title, critic name, review, published site, link, review date.<br><br>


I started with exploratory data analysis where I checked data types, missing values(23 none, less than 1% of data), numerical features, categorical features, checked the percentage of fresh and rotten (for checking imbalanced classes), duplicate reviews (236), checked missing reviews(0 length or space)<br><br>


Then I proceeded with data cleaning, where I removed duplicate reviews and missing values. Then I separated my data into 2 parts – 80% training and 20% test set and converted reviews into bag of words where I extracted all the words from the text and created a vocabulary out of it by creating a vectorizer using Countvectorizer in python.<br><br>


After that I calculated the prior probabilities for fresh and rotten reviews. Then I implemented Naïve Bayes classifier from scratch in Python to find the probability of a given review to be classified in fresh as well as rotten and classified into the class which has a higher probability.<br><br>


To verify the results, I applied cross-validation and after testing it against test data, I got an accuracy of 70%.<br><br>


Lastly, I applied Laplace smoothing and tested the model with different values of smoothing parameter called alpha and cross-validated the model each time.</p>

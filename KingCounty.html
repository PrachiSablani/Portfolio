The objective of this project is to predict house prices in the King County, Washington from the transaction details of houses sold previously.<br><br>



The data has 11000 records with 24 features like number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, location information, zone code, block group, view type, transaction date, build date, etc.<br><br>



To approach this project, I followed all the Data Science pipelines right from Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, and Model building and finally prediction of house prices for unseen data.<br><br>



<b>STEP 1 : Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)</b><br>

I started the project with Exploratory Data Analysis where I checked data types, missing values, numerical features, distribution of numerical features, categorical features, cardinality of categorical features, outliers, relationship between dependent and independent variable, distribution of independent feature.<br><br>



<b>STEP 2: Feature Engineering</b><br>

Firstly, I handed missing values where I imputed different values suitable for that particular feature. Then I converted continuous numerical features to log normal form and standardized the data and took values up to 3 std deviation to deal with outliers. I did the one-hot encoding to convert categorical features to numerical form and applied feature scaling. Also, I removed some unnecessary features like the property id which was not adding any useful value to the house price. I also came up with new features, for example I subtracted the year in which the houses were sold to the year they were built and created a new feature. Also, I fetched out the month from transaction dates to check month-wise transactions.<br>
<br>


<b>STEP 3: Feature Selection</b><br>

I applied Pearsonâ€™s Correlation matrix and Random Forest for checking the feature importance and selecting useful features. Finally, out of 24 I was left with 7 useful features to predict the house prices.<br><br>



<b>STEP 4 : Model Building</b><br>

I split this data into training and validation set to track the performance of my model using cross-validation technique.<br>


First, I started with linear regression as a baseline model, which gave me a R-squared value of 0.73. Then I moved towards more sophisticated models like random forest and XGBoost. And finally, after 5-fold cross validation I got the best mean R-squared value of 0.83 for house price prediction with XGBoost model.
